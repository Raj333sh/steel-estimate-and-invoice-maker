📐 How Weight is Calculated

Steel weight is calculated using the standard formula:

Weight (kg) = Volume (m³) × Density of Steel (7850 kg/m³)


Each shape has a different volume formula.
Example:
Round Bar:

Weight = (π × D² / 4) × Length × 7850


This tool automatically applies the correct formula based on the selected steel section.
